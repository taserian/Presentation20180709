    "# Scheduling a Doubles Pickleball Tournament\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend Steve asked for help in creating a schedule for a round-robin doubles pickleball tournament with 8 or 9 players on 2 courts. ([Pickleball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball) is a paddle/ball/net game played on a court that is smaller than tennis but larger than ping-pong.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize: given *P* players and *C* available courts, we would like to create a **schedule**: a table where each row is a time period (a round of play), each column is a court, and each cell contains a game, which consists of two players partnered together and pitted against two other players. The preferences for the schedule are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player should partner with each other player exactly once (or as close to that as possible).\n",
    "- Fewer rounds are better (in other words, try to fill all the courts each round).\n",
    "- Each player should play against each other player twice, or as close to that as possible.\n",
    "- A player should not be scheduled to play two games at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's a perfect schedule for *P*=8 players on *C*=2 courts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [([[1, 6], [2, 4]], [[3, 5], [7, 0]]),\n",
    "     ([[1, 5], [3, 6]], [[2, 0], [4, 7]]),\n",
    "     ([[2, 3], [6, 0]], [[4, 5], [1, 7]]),\n",
    "     ([[4, 6], [3, 7]], [[1, 2], [5, 0]]),\n",
    "     ([[1, 0], [6, 7]], [[3, 4], [2, 5]]),\n",
    "     ([[2, 6], [5, 7]], [[1, 4], [3, 0]]),\n",
    "     ([[2, 7], [1, 3]], [[4, 0], [5, 6]])]\n",
    "     \n",
    "This means that in the first round, players 1 and 6 partner against 2 and 4 on one court, while 3 and 5 partner against 7 and 0 on the other. There are 7 rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy for finding a good schedule is to use **hillclimbing**: start with an initial schedule, then repeatedly alter the schedule by swapping partners in one game with partners in another. If the altered schedule is better, keep it; if not, discard it. Repeat. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding it up\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First form all pairs of players, using `all_pairs(P)`.\n",
    "- Put pairs together to form a list of games using `initial_games`.\n",
    "- Use `Schedule` to create a schedule; it calls `one_round` to create each round and `scorer` to evaluate the schedule.\n",
    "- Use `hillclimb` to improve the initial schedule: call `alter` to randomly alter a schedule, `Schedule` to re-allocate the games to rounds and courts, and `scorer` to check if the altered schedule's score is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: with *P* players there are *P &times; (P - 1) / 2* pairs of partners; this is an even number when either *P* or *P - 1* is divisible by 4, so everything works out when, say, *P*=4 or *P*=9,  but for, say, *P*=10 there are 45 pairs, and so `initial_games` chooses to create 22 games, meaning that one pair of players never play together, and thus play one fewer game than everyone else.)"
